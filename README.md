# Stock-Price-Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of an LSTM model for time-series forecasting, specifically predicting stock prices. Here are some key uses:

**1.Stock Price Prediction:**
LSTM models are well-suited for sequential data like stock prices. This project can predict the closing price of stocks based on historical trends, which can help investors make informed decisions.

**2.Financial Planning:**
Companies can use such models to forecast future stock prices, aiding in financial planning, risk management, and investment strategy.

**3.Market Analysis:** 
Analysts can gain insights into stock market behaviors, trends, and volatility by analyzing the predicted vs. actual prices.

**4.Trading Algorithms:**
This model can be integrated into automated trading systems that make buy/sell decisions based on predicted price movements.


**This project uses several key technologies and libraries for building the LSTM model and predicting stock prices:**

**i.Python:** 
The main programming language used for implementing the project.
**ii.LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** 
A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for time-series forecasting.
**iii.pandas:** 
For data manipulation and cleaning, such as filtering stock prices and creating datasets.
**iv.NumPy**:
For numerical operations and handling arrays, used for preparing training and testing data.
**v.scikit-learn:** 
Used for data preprocessing, specifically the MinMaxScaler, which scales the data before feeding it to the LSTM.
**vi.Matplotlib:**
For data visualization, including plotting stock prices and comparing predictions with actual values.
**vii.yfinance:** 
A Python library used to download historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
**viii.Keras with TensorFlow backend:**
Used for building and training the LSTM neural network.
These technologies together provide the tools to retrieve, process, analyze, and visualize stock data while building and training the LSTM model.
